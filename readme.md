#Agar.io clone
##Purpose:
Recreate a single player version of the game found on agar.io.

##Technology
* Canvas
* Javascript

##Implementation
* OOP

##Foreseen Difficulties
* Collision between bodies on the Canvas
* Scaling with simple collision (will be doing a lot of calculations per frame)
* AI for enemy bodies

##Stretch
* Network several players together into the same game
* Large canvas with window following player
* Special abilities
* Add multiple levels to single player mode
* AI specific stretch goals
	* In fleeing state find a path that puts another body between you and the enemy
	* Add an attack state

## Moved to a new project
